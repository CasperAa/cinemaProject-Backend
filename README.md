A list of sprint tasks you expect to complete in this sprint
  Define scope of the project. Setup the base functions (need to have) so we can easily expand functionality.
  Create schemas for the project, and setup core CRUD and REST endpoints. 
  We will most likely be using a movie API to get a bunch of precreated data. 
  Setup endpoints and base page structure on the frontend project.
